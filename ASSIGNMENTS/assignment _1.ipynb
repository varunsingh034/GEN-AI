    "    You directly tell Python to convert a value using built-in functions like int(), float(), str(), list(), tuple(), and set(). This gives you control, but you must ensure the conversion is valid (e.g., you can't convert \"hello\" to an integer).\n",

For mutable types like lists, += often modifies the object in place, meaning no new object is created in memory; the original list just gets bigger.
